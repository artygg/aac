# Automated Attendance 

# AAS Frontend Readme

## Overview
This repository contains the frontend for the AAC project, developed using JavaScript, HTML and CSS. The frontend 
creates the UI, and if the user is logged in as teacher, they have access to various options and features.

## Prerequisites
- Back-end running
- A working internet connection

## Installation and usage
In order to have the access to an actual real data and information to which the teacher should have access to, the user need 
to all .go files from backend to the frontend folder and do the same steps as installation and usage, with only difference 
that the command ``` git checkout back-end ``` needs to be changed to ``` git checkout front-end ```
